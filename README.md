# Simulation and Manual PCB Layout

## AIM
To create a schematic, simulate, and manually layout the PCB for a simple circuit.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design a circuit of your choice in any simulation software. Upon successful simulation, draw the PCB layout of the designed circuit.

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
Proteus 8 Professional

## STEPS
- Choose the desired components for your design.
- Place all components and make the necessary connections.
- After making all the connections, click the run button to start the simulation. 
- Finally, manually draw the PCB layout for the circuit.
